Iâ€™m an extremely hardworking and also pretty handsome AI engineer (doing my best). Iâ€™m also a drummer. I make songs and stuff, but math turns me on even more. My projects are super high-calorie, and my grandma writes the README files for my projects.
Hopefully, Iâ€™ll get rich. If you've seen me somewhere and are considering hiring me for your company, even a non-engineer can tell that you're definitely 500 IQ. Iâ€™m into AI because I want to help it conquer the world #supportthermonuclearbombs.
TensorFlow is my new stepsister. PyTorch will soon join the family tree. For now, Iâ€™m lending table applications to bars to help get people even more drunk. Also, even though I have an Indian-accented English (YouTube tutorials hit hard...), Iâ€™m trying to travel the world.
I learned Russian because, why not?
Finally, here's my special technique, Domain Expansion: Infinite Bugs.
