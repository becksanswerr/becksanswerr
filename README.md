<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kaan </h1>
<p align="center">
</p>

I'm an extremely hardworking (and kinda handsome) AI engineer. Iâ€™m also a drummer. I make songs and stuff, but math turns me on even more. My projects are high-calorie and my grandma writes the README files for me.

I'm into AI because I want to help it conquer the world (*joke*). TensorFlow, PyTorch? Yeah, they're my new stepsisters. My poor RAM cries while I use "re" to vaporize prompts in vector memory. LangChain, you watching this?

I'm running local LLMs, building smarter Agents, and operating entirely on offline hustle. Since I canâ€™t afford API keys, I did the logical thing. Bought a 4070 Super. #priorities #needrtx6000adafornoreason

Hopefully, Iâ€™ll get rich. If youâ€™ve seen me somewhere and are considering hiring me, even a non-engineer can tell youâ€™re definitely 500 IQ.

Also, despite my erudite, eloquent, remarkably proficient and Indian-accented C1 English, I learned Russian too. Because why not?
